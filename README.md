# Football analytics website – Timen Stepišnik Perdih

This repository contains a simple, high-end, single-page website to present the services of **Timen Stepišnik Perdih – data-driven analyst and coach**.

The site is built with plain **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** so it is easy to host anywhere and requires no framework or build tools.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page with all content (hero, about, services, approach, clients, contact).
- `styles.css` – visual design (dark, modern, responsive).
- `script.js` – small enhancements (mobile navigation, smooth scroll, dynamic year).

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser to preview the site locally.

## Customising the site

- **Photo** – in `index.html`, search for `Photo of Timen` and replace the placeholder `<div class="profile-photo placeholder">` with an `<img>` element pointing to your real photo.
- **Content** – update any section text directly in `index.html` if you want to tweak wording, add new services, or change how you describe yourself.
- **Colours & fonts** – adjust the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css` to tweak the colour palette.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (for example `football-analytics-website`).
2. Add these files to the repository (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `README.md` and any images you add for your photo or branding).
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. In the GitHub UI, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Under **Source**, choose the branch you are using (e.g. `main`).
   - Select `/ (root)` as the folder.
   - Save.
5. GitHub will build and provide a public URL for the site (usually `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`).

If you later buy a custom domain, you can point it to this GitHub Pages site through your domain provider and the Pages settings.
